# JSONBin.io

To get started with enabling JSONBin.io Sync for your file, head to the `Sync` tab in the plugin. Choose `JSONBin` to select JSONBin as your Sync Provider.

When you're launching the Sync feature for the first time, you will not have any stored provider credentials on your device. Go ahead and select `Add Credentials`.

For `name`, choose any name you want. You can change the name later on.

Now you'll want to get your credentials from JSONBin. To do that, head to JSONBin.io and register an account.

Once logged in, click on your avatar and select "API-Keys". There you'll find your Secret Key. Copy that and insert it into the `Secret` field in Figma Tokens.

If you want to create a new sync bin, you can leave the ID part blank. The plugin will create a new bin for you. You could also insert an existing ID into this field to link an existing bin.

  When creating a new bin, your tokens get uploaded to that bin. However, when using an existing ID, the tokens stored on the remote will overwrite your existing ones.

### Getting your team on board

Once you set a storage provider on a document, we store the ID and the name of your bin to this document. The Secret is left blank, so each team member will have to add the secret on their own. The reason for that is that in the future we want to enable different permissions based on different users, some only acting as consumers, some as contributors.

### Changing storage credentials

You can change between different stored token bins whenever you want to. To do that, after having created more than one provider item, click `Apply` to apply this token set to the current document.

### Updating tokens

Whenever you update a token, the remote will get updated automatically. There currently is no 'Publish' process in place, other than updating tokens.

### Pulling changes

The plugin will automatically fetch the newest remote tokens on startup. From time to time, your team might have made changes while you had the plugin open, to pull the newest changes, hit the 'Pull from JSONbin' button on the top right.

### Pausing sync

By default, every token change triggers an update on your sync provider. You can pause this behavior by unchecking `Update remote` (in the bottom left dropdown of the plugin).

### Read-only mode
If you'd like some of your team members to only be able to Read tokens, not write, you can add JSONBin with the URL Sync option in the plugin. All you'll need to do is add the URL for the bin, such as `https://api.jsonbin.io/v3/b/1234878172571726252` and headers such as `{ "X-Master-Key":"YOUR_KEY", "X-Access-Key":"YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_", "X-Bin-Meta": false }`. The important part is X-Bin-Meta: false, which is required for JSONBin to only return the tokens, not any metadata they store.
